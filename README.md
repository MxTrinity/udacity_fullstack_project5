This Project creates a a small api driven google maps app that dispalys some of my favorite palces in chicago. Clicking on any of the markers on the map or the titles in the header will open an info window with grabs an article from wikipedia with a dynamic api call. you can also dynamically  filter the displayed markers (which will dynamically hide infowindows associated with the markers) by typing into the filter text box
